<h2> Speciesism in Everyday Language </h2>

**Abstract**

Speciesism refers to the different moral standing given to species, and includes human supremacy over animals, and differentiations between animals, where companion animals are given higher moral standing than other species. Although it is clear that speciesism is culturally encoded, psychological science has revealed more about manifestations of speciesism in individuals’ thought than in collective systems of meaning. We present a quantitative test of speciesism by applying machine-learning methods (word embeddings) to billions of English words derived from conversation, film, books, and the internet. We found evidence of anthropocentric speciesism:words denoting concern (vs. indifference) and value (vs. valuelessness) were more closely associated with words denoting humans compared to most other animals. We also found evidence of companion animal speciesism:the same words were more closely associated with words denoting companion animals compared to other animals. The work presents a large-scale quantitative account of speciesism in everyday language.

<h2> Word Embeddings Indicate Historical Growth in Moral Concern for People, Animals, and the Environment </h2>

**Abstract**

The Enlightenment idea of historical moral progress asserts that civil societies become more moral over time. We tested this by examining how collective linguistic representations of people, animals, and the environment have changed over the 19th and 20th centuries. Specifically, we applied machine-learning methods (word embeddings) to archives of natural language and examined the associations between words denoting moral concern (vs. moral indifference) and words denoting entities spanning family members, ingroups, outgroups, marginalized individuals, animals, and the environment. Study 1 validated these associations by showing that they are greatest for those entities that are afforded the most moral concern (e.g., son) and lowest for those that are afforded the least (e.g., rival). Study 2 showed that these associations grew stronger over the 19th and 20th centuries. The results favor optimistic views of history.

<h2> Derivations of Quantum and Involution Generalized Weyl Algebras </h2>

**Abstract**

We classify the derivations of degree one generalized Weyl algebras over a univariate Laurent polynomial ring. In particular, our results cover the Weyl-Hayashi algebra, a quantization of the first Weyl algebra arising as a primitive factor algebra of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=U_q^{%2B} (\mathfrak{so}_5)">, and a family of algebras which localize to the group algebra of the infinite group with generators <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y">, subject to the relation 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=xy = y^{-1}x">.

<h2> On the Automorphisms of Quantum Weyl Algebras </h2>

**Abstract**

Motivated by Weyl algebra analogues of the Jacobian conjecture and the tame generators problem, we prove quantum versions of these problems for a family of analogues to the Weyl algebras. In particular, our results cover the Weyl–Hayashi algebras and tensor powers of a quantization of the first Weyl algebra which arises as a primitive factor algebra of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=U_q^{%2B} (\mathfrak{so}_5)">.

Jointly authored with Professor Stephane Launois, this article was published in the Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra in 2019.

<h2> Endomorphisms of Quantum Generalized Weyl Algebras </h2>

**Abstract**

We prove that every endomorphism of a simple quantum generalized Weyl algebra A over a commutative Laurent polynomial ring in one variable is an automorphism. This is achieved by obtaining an explicit classification of all endomorphisms of A. Our main result applies to minimal primitive factors of the quantized enveloping algebra <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=U_q (\mathfrak{sl}_2)"> and certain minimal primitive quotients of the positive part of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=U_q^{%2B} (\mathfrak{so}_5)">.

Jointly authored with Professor Stephane Launois, this article was published in the Letters in Mathematical Physics in 2014.
