<h2> On the Automorphisms of Quantum Weyl Algebras </h2>

Abstract
Motivated by Weyl algebra analogues of the Jacobian conjecture and the tame generators problem, we prove quantum versions of these problems for a family of analogues to the Weyl algebras. In particular, our results cover the Weylâ€“Hayashi algebras and tensor powers of a quantization of the first Weyl algebra which arises as a primitive factor algebra of $U_q^+(\mathfrak{so}_5)$.
