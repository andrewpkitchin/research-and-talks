<h2> Derivations of Quantum and Involution Generalized Weyl Algebras </h2>

**Abstract**

We classify the derivations of degree one generalized Weyl algebras over a univariate Laurent polynomial ring. In particular, our results cover the Weyl-Hayashi algebra, a quantization of the first Weyl algebra arising as a primitive factor algebra of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=U_q^{%2B} (\mathfrak{so}_5)">, and a family of algebras which localize to the group algebra of the infinite group with generators <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y">, subject to the relation 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=xy = y^{-1}x">.

<h2> Word Embeddings Reveal Growing Moral Concern for People, Animals and the Environment </h2>

**Abstract**

The Enlightenment idea of historical moral progress asserts that civil societies become more moral over time. This is often understood as an expanding moral circle and is argued to be tightly linked with language use, with some suggesting that shifts in how we express concern for others can be considered an important indicator of moral progress. Our research explores these notions by examining historical trends in natural language use during the 19th and 20th centuries. We found that the associations between words denoting moral concern and words referring to people, animals, and the environment grew stronger over time. The findings support widely-held views about the nature of moral progress by showing that language has changed in a way that reflects greater concern for others.

Joint work with Dr Stefan Leach and Professor Robbie M. Sutton.

<h2> Speciesism in Everyday Language </h2>

**Abstract**

Speciesism, like other forms of prejudice, is thought to be underpinned by biased patterns of language use. Thus far, however, psychological science has primarily focused on how speciesism is reflected in individuals' thoughts as opposed to wider collective systems of meaning such as language. We present a large-scale quantitative test of speciesism by applying machine-learning methods (word embeddings) to billions of English words derived from conversation, film, books, and the Internet. We found evidence of anthropocentric speciesism: words denoting concern (vs. indifference) and value (vs. valueless) were more closely associated with words denoting humans compared to many other animals. We also found evidence of companion animal speciesism: the same words were more closely associated with words denoting companion animals compared to most other animals. The work describes speciesism as a pervasive collective phenomenon that is evident in a naturally occurring expression of human psychology – everyday language.

<h2> On the Automorphisms of Quantum Weyl Algebras </h2>

**Abstract**

Motivated by Weyl algebra analogues of the Jacobian conjecture and the tame generators problem, we prove quantum versions of these problems for a family of analogues to the Weyl algebras. In particular, our results cover the Weyl–Hayashi algebras and tensor powers of a quantization of the first Weyl algebra which arises as a primitive factor algebra of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=U_q^{%2B} (\mathfrak{so}_5)">.

<h2> Endomorphisms of Quantum Generalized Weyl Algebras </h2>

**Abstract**

We prove that every endomorphism of a simple quantum generalized Weyl algebra A over a commutative Laurent polynomial ring in one variable is an automorphism. This is achieved by obtaining an explicit classification of all endomorphisms of A. Our main result applies to minimal primitive factors of the quantized enveloping algebra <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=U_q (\mathfrak{sl}_2)"> and certain minimal primitive quotients of the positive part of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=U_q^{%2B} (\mathfrak{so}_5)">.
