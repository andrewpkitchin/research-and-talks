<h2> Word embeddings point to growing moral concern across the 19th and 20th centuries </h2>

**Abstract**

Prominent ideals assert that historic progress is associated with growing moral concern for entities that are otherwise marginalized or mistreated. This idea remains influential and is consistent with benign historical trends including reductions in violence and legal discrimination. We test this idea by examining shifts in natural language over time--quantified in diachronic word embeddings. We first identify a linguistic association that captures moral concern towards entities spanning family members, friends, strangers, animals, and the environment. We then show that this association has shifted over the 19th and 20th centuries in a way that supports the idea that moral concern is growing. Curiously, this change was more-or-less uniform across different groups of entities. The results favor optimistic views of history by confirming that benign historical changes have likely been accompanied by shifts in natural language.


<h2> Derivations of Quantum and Involution Generalized Weyl Algebras </h2>

**Abstract**

We classify the derivations of degree one generalized Weyl algebras over a univariate Laurent polynomial ring. In particular, our results cover the Weyl-Hayashi algebra, a quantization of the first Weyl algebra arising as a primitive factor algebra of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=U_q^{%2B} (\mathfrak{so}_5)">, and a family of algebras which localize to the group algebra of the infinite group with generators <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y">, subject to the relation 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=xy = y^{-1}x">.

<h2> On the Automorphisms of Quantum Weyl Algebras </h2>

**Abstract**

Motivated by Weyl algebra analogues of the Jacobian conjecture and the tame generators problem, we prove quantum versions of these problems for a family of analogues to the Weyl algebras. In particular, our results cover the Weylâ€“Hayashi algebras and tensor powers of a quantization of the first Weyl algebra which arises as a primitive factor algebra of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=U_q^{%2B} (\mathfrak{so}_5)">.

<h2> Endomorphisms of Quantum Generalized Weyl Algebras </h2>

**Abstract**

We prove that every endomorphism of a simple quantum generalized Weyl algebra A over a commutative Laurent polynomial ring in one variable is an automorphism. This is achieved by obtaining an explicit classification of all endomorphisms of A. Our main result applies to minimal primitive factors of the quantized enveloping algebra <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=U_q (\mathfrak{sl}_2)"> and certain minimal primitive quotients of the positive part of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=U_q^{%2B} (\mathfrak{so}_5)">.
