<h2> Word Embeddings Indicate Historical Growth in Moral Concern for People, Animals, and the Environment </h2>

**Abstract**

The Enlightenment ideal of historical progress asserts that civil societies become more moral over time, and in particular, show increasing moral concern even for their most marginalized members. The idea remains influential and is consistent with benign historical trends including reductions in violence and increases in civil rights legislation. In the absence of historical survey data, however, testing the underlying construct of increasing moral concern is challenging. We examine shifting patterns of language use over time, applying machine-learning techniques referred to as word embeddings, to large databases of natural language spanning the 19th and 20th centuries. Over time, words denoting moral concern (vs. words denoting moral indifference) became increasingly associated with words denoting entities spanning family members, ingroups, outgroups, marginalized individuals, animals, and the environment. The results favor optimistic views of history by confirming that its benign changes have been accompanied by underlying shifts in moral concern.

<h2> Derivations of Quantum and Involution Generalized Weyl Algebras </h2>

**Abstract**

We classify the derivations of degree one generalized Weyl algebras over a univariate Laurent polynomial ring. In particular, our results cover the Weyl-Hayashi algebra, a quantization of the first Weyl algebra arising as a primitive factor algebra of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=U_q^{%2B} (\mathfrak{so}_5)">, and a family of algebras which localize to the group algebra of the infinite group with generators <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y">, subject to the relation 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=xy = y^{-1}x">.

<h2> On the Automorphisms of Quantum Weyl Algebras </h2>

**Abstract**

Motivated by Weyl algebra analogues of the Jacobian conjecture and the tame generators problem, we prove quantum versions of these problems for a family of analogues to the Weyl algebras. In particular, our results cover the Weylâ€“Hayashi algebras and tensor powers of a quantization of the first Weyl algebra which arises as a primitive factor algebra of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=U_q^{%2B} (\mathfrak{so}_5)">.

<h2> Endomorphisms of Quantum Generalized Weyl Algebras </h2>

**Abstract**

We prove that every endomorphism of a simple quantum generalized Weyl algebra A over a commutative Laurent polynomial ring in one variable is an automorphism. This is achieved by obtaining an explicit classification of all endomorphisms of A. Our main result applies to minimal primitive factors of the quantized enveloping algebra <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=U_q (\mathfrak{sl}_2)"> and certain minimal primitive quotients of the positive part of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=U_q^{%2B} (\mathfrak{so}_5)">.
